  "description": "Execute a test flight for FAU's first High-Altitude Balloon (HAB) autonomous recovery system. This groundbreaking mission represents a significant milestone in aerospace engineering, combining advanced balloon technology with autonomous drone recovery capabilities. Our team conducted extensive testing including 10+ drone drop tests to validate system control mechanisms, ultimately achieving a remarkable 105,000 ft apogee. While we encountered challenges such as premature parafoil deployment, these experiences provided invaluable data for system refinement. The mission operated within a $1,100 budget, demonstrating cost-effective innovation in aerospace technology. This project showcases FAU's commitment to advancing autonomous systems and high-altitude research capabilities.",
