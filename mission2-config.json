  "description": "Execute a test flight for FAU's first CubeSat with communications and ground station capabilities. This innovative mission represents a significant advancement in small satellite technology, bringing together three specialized teams for the first time: AXA, Mechanical SD-23 Team, and Computer Science SD-23 Team. This collaborative effort achieved remarkable milestones including the smoothest launch yet and the first integration of a 360Â° camera system. Despite encountering technical challenges such as partial GPS failure, communication system issues, and loss of pressure leading to a premature 69,000 ft apogee, these experiences provided invaluable insights for future missions. Operating within a $3,800 budget, this mission demonstrated FAU's growing expertise in CubeSat development and multi-team collaboration in aerospace engineering.",
